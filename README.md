# EllipsGen

**EllipsGen** is an open-source project designed for the generation of ellipsoidal particles. This tool was developed as part of a research study focused on improving particle generation methods, allowing precise control over particle shapes and distances. The methodology also supports applications in pure mathematics, particularly in dual spaces and surface interactions.

## Features

- **Accurate Ellipsoidal Particle Generation:** Control over shape and distance parameters.  
- **Robust Contact Detection:** Utilizes a custom approach based on ellipsoid geometry.  
- **3D Extension:** Consistent methodology from 2D to 3D cases without special modifications.  
- **Co-Gradient Locus Analysis:** Includes 2D and 3D illustrations with parametrization for robust computation.
